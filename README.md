# ðŸ›¼ Runag

Runag is an attempt to make a shell-only library to deploy linux/macos/windows workstations and servers. Shell is used partially as a way to solve bootstrap problem having a freshly installed system and partially as an exercise in stoicism.

It probably won't help you to deploy some complex setups, but it can configure a pretty solid workstation and bootstrap some simple servers.

You are now looking at the repository which mostly contains a standard library. For the examples of what could be accomplished with the library please check "runagfiles", that resides in other repositories:

  * [ðŸ›· Runagfile to configure a workstation](https://github.com/runag/workstation-runagfile). It creates a computer that I could be used for daily pursuits without much of an additional configuration and setup. It installs and configures software, identities and keys, configures a scheduled backup.

  * [ðŸ§³ Workstation deploy script runagfile](https://github.com/runag/workstation-deploy-script-runagfile). This short script may contain personal identifiable information that you may wish to keep private. It works in tandem with the first runagfile. It provides one command to encompass the whole workstation deployment process.

## One-liner to deploy runag an a new machine

### Linux
```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) [commands...]
```

### MacOS
```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) [commands...]
```

### Commands: 
```sh
add user/repo
run [function_name [function_arguments]]
```

## Offline install

```sh
# create offline install
mkdir runag-offline-install && cd runag-offline-install
runag offline_runag_install::create_or_update

# install from it
bash deploy-offline.sh
```

## Use of the library in scripts or interactive use

Runag is a collection of functions that you might load into your interactive bash terminal or in your scripts with the `. runag` or `source runag` command.

## Runagfile

You could make a file called `runagfile` and then run `runag` to execute commands from it. You could also have a directory called `runagfile` that must contain an `index.sh` file. At your convenience you could organise the rest of the files in that directory.

Possible runagfile locations are:

```sh
# in current working directory
./runagfile.sh
./runagfile/index.sh

# in users home directory
~/.runagfile.sh
~/.runagfile/index.sh

# inside of the collection of runagfiles that were added to a runag installation
~/.runag/runagfiles/*/index.sh
```

## Environment variables


### General

#### `RUNAG_BIN_PATH`

That variable is here to help you to generate scripts or systemd units that might need to use runag.
Anywhere you put runag, the variable will reflect it actual location.
If you put runag into your home directory them value will be `"${HOME}/.runag/bin"`.
You could use that file as an executable or you could source that file in your scripts.

#### `RUNAG_UPDATE_SECRETS`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `RUNAG_VERBOSE`

Could be set to `"true"`


### SSH-related variables

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_MASTER`

Session sharing is enabled by default in runag (except when running on Windows).
By default ControlMaster will be set to `"auto"`.
To disable session sharing, set this to `"no"`.

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_PATH`

Path to the control socket.
By default runag will use `"${HOME}/.ssh/control-socket.%C"`.

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_PERSIST`

To disable `ControlPersist` set this to `"no"`.
By default runag will use `600` seconds.

#### `REMOTE_DIR`

Remote directory to run script in.

#### `REMOTE_ENV`

Space-separated list of environment variable names, to be set in remote script
with the values present in the calling runag instance at the moment of ssh call.
Example list is: `"FOO BAR QUX"`.
For any provided names (or for absence of them),
runag will internaly add `"RUNAG_UPDATE_SECRETS RUNAG_TASK_VERBOSE RUNAG_VERBOSE"`.

#### `REMOTE_HOST`

Host name, for example `"example.com"`.
This variable is required to be set.

#### `REMOTE_IDENTITY_FILE`

Path to identity file, for example `"${HOME}/.ssh/id_ed25519"`.
By default runag will not provide any identity file path so ssh could use it's defaults.

#### `REMOTE_PORT`

Port number. 
By default runag will not provide any port number so ssh could use it's defaults.

#### `REMOTE_SERVER_ALIVE_INTERVAL`

Will set `ServerAliveInterval`.
By default runag will set `"20"` as `ServerAliveInterval`.
You could set this to `"0"` to tell ssh to disable server alive messages.
You could set this to `"no"` then runag will not set that variable at all,
thus ssh could potentially use a value from your ssh config file.

#### `REMOTE_SSH_ARGS`

Additional SSH arguments, array of strings, for example `("-i" "keyfile")`.

#### `REMOTE_UMASK`

Umask for remote commands

#### `REMOTE_USER`

User name.
By default runag will not provide any user name so ssh could use it's defaults.


### Rsync-related variables

#### `RUNAG_RSYNC_ARGS`

Array of strings, for example `("--archive")`

#### `RUNAG_RSYNC_DELETE_AND_BACKUP`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `RUNAG_RSYNC_WITHOUT_CHECKSUMS`

Could be set to `"true"`


### Tasks-related variables

#### `RUNAG_TASK_FAIL_DETECTOR`

Could be set to function name. The function will be called with 3 arguments:

```
$1 # stdout_file (path fo file)
$2 # stderr_file (path fo file)
$3 # task_status (integer exit status)
```

The function must return new exit status which will be assumed to be an exit status of the task.

#### `RUNAG_TASK_KEEP_TEMP_FILES`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `RUNAG_TASK_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS`

Integer

#### `RUNAG_TASK_RECONNECT_DELAY`

Integer (could be float but that depends on your `sleep` command implementation).

#### `RUNAG_TASK_SSH_JUMP`

Run tasks on remote machine through ssh

#### `RUNAG_TASK_STDERR_FILTER`

Could be set to function name. Function is expected to filter it's input. If function output is empty then stderr will not be displayed.

#### `RUNAG_TASK_VERBOSE`

Could be set to `"true"`


### Internal variables, not to be used by non-library code

```
RUNAG_NODENV_INITIALIZED
RUNAG_RBENV_INITIALIZED
RUNAG_TASK_OMIT_TITLE
RUNAG_TASK_TITLE
```

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated

then please add a line saying:

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your_email@example.org>

to each of your commit messages using your real name. You could use `git commit -s` to help you with that.

In some cases, we may agree that you use a pseudonym for a contributions. You will be required to provide us with your real name using private channels with the agreement that we will make your real name public after some time. Upon our agreement, this can be a significant period, for example, 10 years after the initial contribution, maybe more. The use of pseudonyms for the contributions must not be a means to hide unauthorized use of intellectual property or to circumvent contractual obligations. We may accept contributions under the pseudonyms if the author has reason to be concerned for their safety or feels restricted in their freedom of expression as a result of societal pressure.

We want as much of the project as possible to be self-contained in the form of a collection of source code and data. Keeping the private list of contributors requires some ongoing effort of people or organizations, that is such a resource that we do not always have in sufficient quantity. However, we understand that sometimes this may be necessary and will try to help you.
