# R√πnag

üíú R√πnag is an attempt to make a shell-only library to deploy linux/macos/windows workstations and servers. Shell is used partially as a way to solve bootstrap problem having a freshly installed system and partially as an exercise in stoicism.

It probably won't help you to deploy some complex setups, but it can configure a pretty solid workstation and bootstrap some simple servers.

You are now looking at the repository which mostly contains a standard library. For the examples of what could be accomplished with the library please check "r√πnagfiles", that resides in other repositories:

* [üíö R√πnagfile to configure a workstation](https://github.com/runag/workstation-runagfile). It creates a computer that could be used for daily pursuits without much of an additional configuration and setup. It installs and configures software, identities and keys, configures a scheduled backup.


## One-liner to deploy r√πnag an a new machine

### Linux
```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) [commands...]
```

### MacOS
```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) [commands...]
```

### Commands: 
```sh
add user/repo
run [function_name [function_arguments]]
```

## R√πnagfile

Possible r√πnagfile locations are:

```sh
# in current working directory
./runagfile.sh

# in home directory
~/.runag/runagfiles/*/runagfile.sh
```


## Interactive use or use in scripts besides r√πnagfiles

You may load R√πnag into your interactive bash terminal or in your scripts with the `. runag` or `source runag` command.

## Environment variables
 

### General

#### `RUNAG_VERBOSE`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `RUNAG_DIST_REPO`

TODO

### SSH-related variables

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_MASTER`

Session sharing is enabled by default in r√πnag (except when running on Windows).
By default ControlMaster will be set to `"auto"`.
To disable session sharing, set this to `"no"`.

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_PATH`

Path to the control socket.
By default r√πnag will use `"${HOME}/.ssh/control-socket.%C"`.

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_PERSIST`

To disable `ControlPersist` set this to `"no"`.
By default r√πnag will use `600` seconds.

#### `REMOTE_DIR`

Remote directory to run script in.

#### `REMOTE_ENV`

String, space-separated list of environment variable names, to be set in remote script with the values present in the calling r√πnag instance at the moment of ssh call.
For any provided names (or for absence of them), r√πnag will internaly add `"RUNAG_VERBOSE"`.

#### `REMOTE_FORWARD_AGENT`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `REMOTE_HOST`

Host name, for example `"example.com"`.

#### `REMOTE_IDENTITY_FILE`

Path to identity file, for example `"${HOME}/.ssh/id_ed25519"`.
By default r√πnag will not provide any identity file path so ssh could use it's defaults.

#### `REMOTE_KEEP_TEMP_FILES`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `REMOTE_LOCALE`

String.

#### `REMOTE_PORT`

Port number. 
By default r√πnag will not provide any port number so ssh could use it's defaults.

#### `REMOTE_RECONNECT_DELAY`

Integer (could be float but that depends on your `sleep` command implementation).

#### `REMOTE_RECONNECT_TIME_LIMIT`

Seconds, integer

#### `REMOTE_SERVER_ALIVE_INTERVAL`

Will set `ServerAliveInterval`.
By default r√πnag will set `"20"` as `ServerAliveInterval`.
You could set this to `"0"` to tell ssh to disable server alive messages.
You could set this to `"no"` then r√πnag will not set that variable at all,
thus ssh could potentially use a value from your ssh config file.

#### `REMOTE_UMASK`

Umask for remote commands

#### `REMOTE_USER`

User name.
By default r√πnag will not provide any user name so ssh could use it's defaults.
