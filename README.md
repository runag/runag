# R√πnag

üíú R√πnag is an attempt to make a shell-only library to deploy linux/macos/windows workstations and servers. Shell is used partially as a way to solve bootstrap problem having a freshly installed system and partially as an exercise in stoicism.

It probably won't help you to deploy some complex setups, but it can configure a pretty solid workstation and bootstrap some simple servers.

You are now looking at the repository which mostly contains a standard library. For the examples of what could be accomplished with the library please check "r√πnagfiles", that resides in other repositories:

  * [üíö R√πnagfile to configure a workstation](https://github.com/runag/workstation-runagfile). It creates a computer that I could be used for daily pursuits without much of an additional configuration and setup. It installs and configures software, identities and keys, configures a scheduled backup.

## One-liner to deploy r√πnag an a new machine

### Linux
```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) [commands...]
```

### MacOS
```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) [commands...]
```

### Commands: 
```sh
add user/repo
run [function_name [function_arguments]]
```

## Offline install

```sh
# create offline install
mkdir runag-offline-install && cd runag-offline-install
runag offline_runag_install::create_or_update

# install from it
bash deploy-offline.sh
```

## Use of the library in scripts or interactive use

R√πnag is a collection of functions that you might load into your interactive bash terminal or in your scripts with the `. runag` or `source runag` command.

## R√πnagfile

You could make a file called `runagfile` and then run `runag` to execute commands from it. You could also have a directory called `runagfile` that must contain an `index.sh` file. At your convenience you could organise the rest of the files in that directory.

Possible r√πnagfile locations are:

```sh
# in current working directory
./runagfile.sh
./runagfile/index.sh

# in users home directory
~/.runagfile.sh
~/.runagfile/index.sh

# inside of the collection of r√πnagfiles that were added to a r√πnag installation
~/.runag/runagfiles/*/index.sh
```

## Environment variables


### General

#### `RUNAG_BIN_PATH`

That variable is here to help you to generate scripts or systemd units that might need to use r√πnag.
Anywhere you put r√πnag, the variable will reflect it actual location.
If you put r√πnag into your home directory them value will be `"${HOME}/.runag/bin"`.
You could use that file as an executable or you could source that file in your scripts.

#### `RUNAG_UPDATE_SECRETS`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `RUNAG_VERBOSE`

Could be set to `"true"`


### SSH-related variables

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_MASTER`

Session sharing is enabled by default in r√πnag (except when running on Windows).
By default ControlMaster will be set to `"auto"`.
To disable session sharing, set this to `"no"`.

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_PATH`

Path to the control socket.
By default r√πnag will use `"${HOME}/.ssh/control-socket.%C"`.

#### `REMOTE_CONTROL_PERSIST`

To disable `ControlPersist` set this to `"no"`.
By default r√πnag will use `600` seconds.

#### `REMOTE_DIR`

Remote directory to run script in.

#### `REMOTE_ENV`

Space-separated list of environment variable names, to be set in remote script
with the values present in the calling r√πnag instance at the moment of ssh call.
For any provided names (or for absence of them),
r√πnag will internaly add `"RUNAG_UPDATE_SECRETS RUNAG_TASK_VERBOSE RUNAG_VERBOSE"`.

#### `REMOTE_HOST`

Host name, for example `"example.com"`.
This variable is required to be set.

#### `REMOTE_IDENTITY_FILE`

Path to identity file, for example `"${HOME}/.ssh/id_ed25519"`.
By default r√πnag will not provide any identity file path so ssh could use it's defaults.

#### `REMOTE_PORT`

Port number. 
By default r√πnag will not provide any port number so ssh could use it's defaults.

#### `REMOTE_SERVER_ALIVE_INTERVAL`

Will set `ServerAliveInterval`.
By default r√πnag will set `"20"` as `ServerAliveInterval`.
You could set this to `"0"` to tell ssh to disable server alive messages.
You could set this to `"no"` then r√πnag will not set that variable at all,
thus ssh could potentially use a value from your ssh config file.

#### `REMOTE_SSH_ARGS`

Additional SSH arguments, array of strings, for example `("-i" "keyfile")`.

#### `REMOTE_UMASK`

Umask for remote commands

#### `REMOTE_USER`

User name.
By default r√πnag will not provide any user name so ssh could use it's defaults.


### Rsync-related variables

#### `RUNAG_RSYNC_ARGS`

Array of strings, for example `("--archive")`

#### `RUNAG_RSYNC_DELETE_AND_BACKUP`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `RUNAG_RSYNC_WITHOUT_CHECKSUMS`

Could be set to `"true"`


### Tasks-related variables

#### `RUNAG_TASK_FAIL_DETECTOR`

Could be set to function name. The function will be called with 3 arguments:

```
$1 # stdout_file (path fo file)
$2 # stderr_file (path fo file)
$3 # task_status (integer exit status)
```

The function must return new exit status which will be assumed to be an exit status of the task.

#### `RUNAG_TASK_KEEP_TEMP_FILES`

Could be set to `"true"`

#### `RUNAG_TASK_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS`

Integer

#### `RUNAG_TASK_RECONNECT_DELAY`

Integer (could be float but that depends on your `sleep` command implementation).

#### `RUNAG_TASK_SSH_JUMP`

Run tasks on remote machine through ssh

#### `RUNAG_TASK_STDERR_FILTER`

Could be set to function name. Function is expected to filter it's input. If function output is empty then stderr will not be displayed.

#### `RUNAG_TASK_VERBOSE`

Could be set to `"true"`


### Internal variables, not to be used by non-library code

```
RUNAG_NODENV_INITIALIZED
RUNAG_RBENV_INITIALIZED
RUNAG_TASK_OMIT_TITLE
RUNAG_TASK_TITLE
```
