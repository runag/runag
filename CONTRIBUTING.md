# Contributing

## Style guide

Please use [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).

We mostly follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) for shell scripts.

## Use of pseudonyms

We accept contributions under pseudonyms. We think this could help some of us who feel that their freedom of expression is limited by societal pressures. The use of pseudonyms should not serve as a means to conceal unauthorized use of intellectual property or to circumvent contractual obligations.

We require you to provide us with your real name using private channels and to agree that we publicly disclose your real name 10 years after your last contribution. The reason for this is that we seek to keep this project as self-contained as possible. It's easier for us to keep a list of contributors publicly available.
