# Contributing

## Style guide

Please use [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/). If it is not integrated into your editor, you could run `./lint.sh`.

We mostly follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).

## Developer's Certificate of Origin

Inspired by practices of [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) we use [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) to help us track contributions. 

If you can certify the below:

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

then please add a line saying:

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your_email@example.org>

to each of your commit messages using your real name. You could use `git commit -s` to help you with that.

## Use of pseudonyms

In some cases, we may agree that you use a pseudonym for a contributions. You will be required to provide us with your real name using private channels with the agreement that we will make your real name public after some time. Upon our agreement, this can be a significant period, for example, 10 years after the initial contribution, maybe more. The use of pseudonyms for the contributions must not be a means to hide unauthorized use of intellectual property or to circumvent contractual obligations. We may accept contributions under the pseudonyms if the author has reason to be concerned for their safety or feels restricted in their freedom of expression as a result of societal pressure.

We want as much of the project as possible to be self-contained in the form of a collection of source code and data. Keeping the private list of contributors requires some ongoing effort of people or organizations, that is such a resource that we do not always have in sufficient quantity. However, we understand that sometimes this may be necessary and will try to help you.
