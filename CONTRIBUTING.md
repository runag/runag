# Contributing

## Style guide

Please use [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/). If it is not integrated into your editor, you could run `./lint.sh`.

We mostly follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).

## Use of pseudonyms

We accept contributions under pseudonyms. We think this might help some of us who feel their freedom of expression is limited by societal pressures. The use of pseudonyms for contributions should not serve as a means to conceal unauthorized use of intellectual property or to circumvent contractual obligations.

We require you to provide us with your real name using private channels and to agree that we publicly disclose your real name 10 years after your last contribution. The reason for this is that we strive to keep the project as self-contained as possible, and the public list of contributors is much more convenient in this regard.
