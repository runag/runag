# ### `dir::ensure_exists`
#
# Ensures a directory exists with the specified properties. This function creates the directory if it doesn't exist 
# and applies the desired permissions, ownership, and group settings. Additionally, it provides options for running 
# the commands with elevated privileges or limiting access to the current user only.
#
# #### Usage
#
# `dir::ensure_exists` [OPTIONS] <path>
#
# - `-m|--mode <permissions>`: Set the directory's permissions in numeric form (e.g., 0755).
# - `-o|--owner <username>`: Set the directory's owner.
# - `-g|--group <groupname>`: Set the directory's group.
# - `-s|--sudo`: Use elevated privileges (sudo) for creating and modifying the directory.
# - `-u|--user-only`: Shortcut to set permissions to 0700 and ownership to the current user.
# - `<path>`: The path of the directory to ensure exists.
#
# #### Example
#
# ```bash
# dir::ensure_exists --mode 0755 --owner user --group admin /path/to/directory
# dir::ensure_exists --user-only /secure/directory
# dir::ensure_exists --sudo /path/to/dir
# ```
dir::ensure_exists() {
  local mode
  local owner
  local group
  local sudo

  # The following commented line is not currently in use but could be used to fetch the group of the current user.
  # group="$(awk -F: -v user="${USER}" '$1 == user {print $4}' /etc/passwd)"
