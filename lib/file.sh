# ### `file::write`
#
# Writes data to a file, with options for permissions, ownership, and input sources.
# This function provides multiple methods to write to a file, such as copying, consuming a file,
# capturing output, or writing strings directly. It ensures the file exists with correct properties.
#
# #### Usage
#
# file::write [options]... <file_path> [input_data]
#
# Options:
#   -m, --mode <mode>                Set file permissions in numeric format (e.g., 0644).
#   -o, --owner <owner>              Set the file owner.
#   -g, --group <group>              Set the file group ownership.
#   -s, --sudo                       Use elevated privileges for operations.
#   -r, --root                       Set "root" as the file owner and enable elevated privileges.
#   -u, --user-only                  Restrict access to the current user (default mode: 0600).
#   -d, --mkdir                      Create parent directories if they don't exist.
#   -c, --copy <source_file>         Copy content from an existing file.
#   -n, --consume <source_file>      Move content from an existing file and delete it afterward.
#   -p, --capture                    Capture output from a command to write to the file.
#   -e, --allow-empty                Allow empty input to be written.
#   --<filter-command> [options]...  Apply a filter command to the input data.
#
# #### Example
#
# # Write "Hello, World!" to a file with user-only access
# file::write --user-only /path/to/file "Hello, World!"
#
# # Copy content from an existing file
# file::write --copy /source/file /destination/file
#
# # Capture output of a command
# file::write --capture /path/to/file ls -la
